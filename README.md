This is a rather crude chunk of code for synchronizing a directory of (text) files with a SimpleNote account using its API v 2.x.

My background notes/context are at:
 * http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/z2012-07-13-SimplenoteAndNotationalvelocityDumpingLocalNotes
 * http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/z2012-10-06-SimpleNoteSynchWithPython
 
This isn't a finished/packaged chunk of code, but some building blocks.

At time of first upload, this has pieces to
 * take a snapshot of what's already in the cloud account
 * push a bunch of local files into the cloud (adding or updating)

As I add more true synch features I'll update the code.
